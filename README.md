# Dog Image Generator
Simple JavaScript application that lets a user select a dog breed from a dropdown list and click a button to render an image of the selected dog breed. Data is fetched from the Dog API(https://dog.ceo/dog-api/). First, an array of dog breeds is fetched and used to build a dropdown list of the various dog breeds. Then, using the information from the user, the image is fetched from the Dog API and then rendered onto a grid layout.
